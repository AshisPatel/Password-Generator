## End Note - A Thank You to the Reader 

Thank you for taking the time to check out my password generator and README! This time, I had an interesting journey realizing the true utility behind functions and arrays. Please enjoy the following fun fact, and one of my favorite gifs! Hopefully, they provide you with some entertainment, or at least gives you something fun to share with a friend! 

**Fun Fact**: Koalas sleep between 18-22 hours per day! This is because their diet, which consists strictly of eucalyptus, takes an incredible amount of effort to digest. In addition to that, the eucalyptus doesn't provide much energy... hence all the sleeping. Apparently, this is the high cost to being an adorable marsupial. Regardless, some days I am highly tempted to identify as a koala.
